# Requirements

For newbie auto players, they may be wondering 'How do i run this script if i don't even know how to use things?'. Well, here is the answer for that question.

#### Pandora v2.02+

You need Pandora so the script can be executed and your bots can start rotating farms automaticly.&#x20;

#### Remote Desktop Connection ( RDP )

You can buy Remote Desktop Connection ( RDP ) so that the script can run 24 / 7 without any problem or consuming your local PC.

#### Bot Accounts

You need to stock them so that you can always rotate your farms and get a lot of world locks.

#### SOCKS5 Proxy ( OPTIONAL )

In our opinion, using SOCKS5 proxy is better than using default Remote Desktop Connection ( RDP ) IP Address or even VPN.&#x20;

#### VPN ( OPTIONAL )

Alternative way of using SOCKS5 Proxy, you can use VPN to run the script and make your bots online. But sometimes VPN is not stable at all and could causes random ban ( IP Conflict ), random  ercon ( Too Many Bots Connected ), etc.
