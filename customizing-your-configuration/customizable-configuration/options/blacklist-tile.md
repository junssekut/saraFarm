# Blacklist Tile

You can add as much as blacklisted tile as you want so it won't get processed by the bot.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tile needs an `x` and `y` key to proceed getting blacklisted.
{% endhint %}

#### Example

```lua
blacklistTile = {
    { x = 22, y = 34 },
    { x = 23, y = 34 }
}
```
