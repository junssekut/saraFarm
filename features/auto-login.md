# Auto Login

This is the most basic feature of the script where you can chill and let the script do the rest for you while the script is trying to login your bot one by one.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You need the bots config to be set up [bots-configuration](../customizing-your-configuration/bots-configuration/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to wait for the message `Re Execute Script!` before you re-execute them again.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
`Select All` checkbox will be automatically selected after the auto login process is done, so all you got to do is hit the `Execute` button!
{% endhint %}
