# Rotation

Rotation setting is best for rotation service seller or _jastip rotasi_. Where you can set how many rotation do you need before the bot will stop itself. For example if you set the rotation to `3` then it will stop after `3` rotation is done, `1` rotation = `1` world list or `14` worlds. Then it would take ( `14*3` ) worlds before the bot stop.

{% endhint %}

#### Example

```lua
rotation = 1
```
