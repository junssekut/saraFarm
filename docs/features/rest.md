# Rest

Rest is supposed to make your bot avoid ban waves and random mod suspension.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You need to set up your config, [rest.md](../customizing-your-configuration/customizable-configuration/options/rest.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Rest was originally made by me junssekut#4964 and my friend Zuqnos#0511, but eventually the script got leaked out and it got used by everyone else. It was invented to avoid ban waves when no one really find a way to counter ban waves at that time ( 2021 ).
